## Possible Features

- Do research on possible popular audio file implementations, and be able to embed them using ffmpeg.

- Implement embedding and extraction with optional image masking.

#### Batch files
- Create functionality for batch file embeding or extracting.
- Make do with a bash script first, and then begin writing functionality once that isn't enough.

#### Unicode sound tags
- Try implementing better regex to support Unicode sound tags.

#### Add Progress Bar
- A progress bar would be nice for longer embeddings and extractions, however the program executes so quickly anyways that this is not top priority.
